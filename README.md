Caml is a general-purpose programming language, designed with program safety and reliability in mind. It is very expressive, yet easy to learn and use. Caml supports functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming styles. It has been developed and distributed by INRIA, a French research institute in computer science and applied mathematics, since 1985.

## GitHub notes

Clone the current GitHub remote repository contents into local machine.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/syakirharis25/Caml.git
$ git remote -v
$ git status
```

If the **_refusing to merge unrelated histories_** shown due to the changing name of the working directory on the local machine, then execute this commands.
```
$ git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

If there is any changes in the GitHub (remote) repository, first we need to pull the changes into our local machine, before adding the new contents into GitHub.
```
$ git status
$ git remote -v
$ git pull origin master
$ git add <file>
$ git commit -m "message or remarks about the action done"
$ git push origin
$ git status
```
